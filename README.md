# Cardiac-Arrest-Prediction
CARDIAC ARREST PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The cardiovascular disease known as coronary heart disease (CHD) is characterized by narrowing or blockage of the blood arteries that nourish the heart muscle. This results in decreased blood flow and possible heart-related problems. If left untreated, this may possibly result in a heart attack. To implement a Machine Learning Model that can accurately predict cardiac arrest risk based on readily available patient data is the primary goal of the project. Finding the elements that have the biggest effects on a patient is another aspect of this study. After the data has beencleaned and processed, understanding the influence of various variables is being done utilizing the many visualization approaches available. Following the completion of data balancing and feature selection, five distinct machine learning models — logistic regression, random forest, gradient boost model, k-nearest neighbors algorithmand support vector machine — are put into practice.

 Our research makes use of NHANES data from 1999-2000 to 2015-2016. The dataset is
 created by merging the demographic, examination, laboratory, and questionnaire data
 of 37,079 (CHD- 1300, Non-CHD- 35,779) persons. The age and gender of survey
 participants at the time of screening are demographic characteristics. The examination
 data on participant weight, height, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) are also
 treated as a collection of risk factor variables to examine their effect on cardiovascular
 illnesses. Depending on their age and gender, NHANES collects laboratory and survey
 data from individuals every two years. Furthermore, a thorough list of risk factor factors
 is picked from laboratory tests conducted based on previously validated experimental
 research. Questionnaire data consists of questions asked at home by interviewers utilizing
 the NHANES website’s Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system
